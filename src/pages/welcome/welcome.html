          Recess is a research project at the University of Waterloo led by the School of Computer Science and
          Department of Kinesiology to promote physical activity.

        <p>
          Increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary time is important for overall health and
          wellness. However, many individuals are not active enough to meet recommended guidelines
          for health benefits. The purpose of this study is to determine which features of a smartphone
          application (app, called RECESS) are effective in improving daily physical activity and reducing
          sedentary (sitting, lying) time. Participation in this study will involve downloading RECESS. You
          will then provide some information about yourself (e.g. age, occupation, physical activity level).
          The app will then download 1 week of your prior activity data (from Apple Health or Google
          Health) to provide information about your current activity. You will then use the RECESS app for
          three weeks. The features of RECESS will vary week to week so that we can investigate which
          features are more effective in promoting activity. The features may include goal setting and
          giving and receiving coaching from a buddy with similar activity levels and/or goals. While the
          app monitors you physical activity and sedentary behaviour, you are not required to change
          your behaviour but we hope that the feedback may help you meet physical activity targets.Â  No
          intense activity is recommended, simply being active more often through light activity over the
          course of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are looking for individuals between the ages of 18-99 to participate. Your participation is
          voluntary. You can withdraw from the study at any time by deleting RECESS from your smart
          phone. By indicating yes at the end of this information letter, you indicate your consent to
          participate in this study.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no known or anticipated risks to participating in this study. It is important for you to
          know that any information that you provide and share will be anonymous and confidential.
          RECESS is programmed to collect responses and data by study ID. It will not collect any
          information that could potentially identify you (such as name or phone identifiers). The
          RECESS app will collect the available amount of steps and distance walked prior to one week of
          the app installation until the app is removed or the recess service disabled. In addition, usage
          behaviour of the app itself like open and close times, duration of usage and interaction with user
          interface elements is recorded. Every user input through the built-in messaging system is stored
          with a corresponding time value. The app will not be accessing any potentially sensitive
          information on the phone (e.g. email, web browsing data, photos), the only data accessed
          outside of the RECESS app is the activity data from Apple Health (iOS) or Google Health
          (Android).
        </p>
        <p>
          The data collected through RECESS will be transmitted and stored in Firebase, which is a cloud
          service provided by Google. When information is transmitted over the internet (such as through
          Firebase), privacy cannot be guaranteed. There is always a risk your data may be intercepted
          by a third party (e.g., government agencies, hackers). The data will be electronically archived
          after completion of the study and maintained on an password protected, encrypted computer at
          the University of Waterloo for seven years and then erased.
