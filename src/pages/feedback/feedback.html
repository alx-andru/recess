    Thank you for participating in this research study. Your participation is extremely valuable. As a reminder, the
    purpose of this study is to determine which features of a smart phone application (called RECESS) are effective in
    improving daily physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour. This information will be used to help us
    understand how we can increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour, and if this can be achieved using
    different features of a smartphone application.

    Please remember that all data was collected anonymously. We will share this information with the research community
    through seminars, conferences, presentations, and journal articles. If you are interested in receiving copies of

    This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics
    Committee (ORE#22034).

    <strong>DISLOSURE:</strong> In the study, you were paired with a ‘buddy’ for the purpose of mutual coaching towards
    your activity
    goals. In fact, this ‘buddy’ was not another participant. The coaching that you received was provided by a chatbot,
    with possible supplementation by a researcher. Prior research showed that pairing with another individual may
    increase
    your likelihood of changing behaviour. However, pairing individuals may be difficult or infeasible in research and
    in
    practice. Pairing you with a chatbot buddy helps us understand whether coaching in this form is effective and
    feasible. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:ppoupart@uwaterloo.ca">ppoupart@uwaterloo.ca</a>.
